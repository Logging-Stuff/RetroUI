import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

<Button variant="outline">Click me</Button>;
```

<br />

#### Drawbacks

- **Manual Setup**: Unlike Chakra or Material UI, you don’t install it as a complete package. You copy and paste components into your project, which can be tedious for some developers.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires some familiarity with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI to fully unlock its potential.

<br />

#### Use Case

Ideal for developers who want full control over styling and component behavior while maintaining a modern design system. Especially great for teams building custom design systems or wanting highly optimized Next.js apps without the bloat.

<br />
<br />

## [3. Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com)

![ChakraUI cover](https://pub-5f7cbdfd9ffa4c838e386788f395f0c4.r2.dev/chakraui_landing_w_frame.png)

**Chakra UI** is a popular React component library known for its simplicity, accessibility, and developer-friendly API. It provides a comprehensive set of pre-styled components that speed up the development of clean, responsive UIs.

<br />

#### Why Chakra UI in 2025?

- **Large Selection of Components**: Comes with a wide range of ready-to-use components like modals, forms, alerts, icons, cards, and more.
- **Prop-Based Styling**: Uses a utility prop system that makes styling components intuitive and efficient without writing separate CSS.
- **Theming Support**: Fully customizable theme system with support for dark mode and a live theme playground.
- **Accessibility Built-in**: All components follow WAI-ARIA standards and are keyboard-navigable by default.
- **Helpful Utilities**: Includes extra helper components and hooks such as useDisclosure, useToast, and more for managing UI state easily.

```tsx
import { FormatNumber } from "@chakra-ui/react";

<FormatNumber value={1234.45} style="currency" currency="USD" />;
```

<br />

#### Drawbacks

- **Bundle Size**: The total package size exceeds 2MB (unpacked), and when combined with dependencies, it can add notable weight to your application.
- **Less Tailwind-Friendly**: Chakra’s styling system differs from utility-first frameworks like Tailwind, which may be limiting for some teams.

<br />

#### Use Case

Perfect for developers who want to move fast without worrying about styling from scratch. Great for dashboards, admin panels, and apps where accessibility and design consistency are important out-of-the-box.

## [4. MUI (Material UI)](https://mui.com)

  Click Me
</Button>;
```

<br />

#### Drawbacks

- **Large Bundle Size**: MUI’s component richness comes at the cost of performance — it can significantly increase bundle size.
- **Style Customization Can Be Verbose**: Overriding styles using the sx prop or styled() can be less intuitive for Tailwind or Chakra users.

<br />

#### Use Case

Best for enterprise-level applications or teams that want a robust, scalable, and production-ready UI solution with built-in accessibility and design consistency. Ideal for admin dashboards, CRMs, and SaaS platforms.

## [5. Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com)

**Radix UI** is a low-level UI component library that provides unstyled, accessible primitives for building custom and highly flexible interfaces. Rather than giving you styled components, it offers logic and behavior, allowing complete control over design.

<br />

#### Why Radix UI in 2025?

- **Unstyled by Design**: Gives you complete styling freedom using any CSS approach — Tailwind, CSS Modules, Styled Components, etc.
- **Accessibility First**: Every component adheres to WAI-ARIA standards and comes with built-in accessibility logic.
- **Composability**: Components are built as primitives, allowing you to compose and extend them to suit your design needs.
- **Framework-Agnostic**: While optimized for React, Radix UI is modular enough to be integrated into various setups, including modern Next.js apps.
- **Consistent API**: Offers a unified API across all components, making it predictable and easy to use once you're familiar with one.

```tsx
import * as Switch from "@radix-ui/react-switch";

<Switch.Root className="...">
  <Switch.Thumb className="..." />
</Switch.Root>;
```

<br />

#### Drawbacks

- **No Styling Included**: Beginners may find it harder to use, as it requires pairing with a styling solution (e.g., Tailwind CSS).
- **Not a Full UI Kit**: Radix UI doesn’t provide all the components you'd find in traditional UI libraries (e.g., tables, charts, etc.).

<br />

#### Use Case

Perfect for developers and teams who want full control over their UI design and behavior. Ideal for custom design systems and projects where flexibility and accessibility are top priorities.

<br />
<br />
